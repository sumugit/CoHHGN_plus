This is our implementation for the paper:

_Pseudo Session-based Recommendation with Hierarchical Embedding and Session Attributes_ 

Yuta Sumiya, Ryusei Numata, Satoshi Takahashi

_at DS, 2023_

Environments: Python 3.9, Pytorch 1.13.1, Numpy 1.24.1

The data used in this study was provided by the sponsors of the Data Analysis Competition, Joint Association Study Group of Management Science (JASMAC) and Rakuten Group, Inc., and it consists of Rakuten marketplace purchase history data from 2019 to 2020.

By using any observed browsing and purchase history data that includes criteria such as the user's gender and location, you can conduct similar experiments to evaluate pseudo-session behaviors.
